This is a very rudimentary perl module for accessing
facebook.  It's intended currently for desktop applications,
although hopefully a web version will soon be available.

Released under the GPL, but if that's too restrictive
for you, just contact me, I'm very flexible.

Note: You need to have a 'browser' command in your PATH
in order for this to work for now.  A simple one could be:

#!/bin/sh
# File: /usr/bin/browser
/usr/bin/firefox $*
